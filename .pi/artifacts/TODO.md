### 2026-08-24 - Phase 0: architecture due diligence for Solid + GPUI OSS repo
status: done (2026-08-24 — Q1–Q3 decided, spec frozen; community probe moved to Phase 1 block)

- [x] Research gpuix repo (architecture, license gap, npm traction, fork burden) — prior session
- [x] Analyze fork embed patch (`MacPlatform::new_embedded` + `pump_events`, 1 file, +316/−31)
- [x] Verify upstream PR zed-industries/zed#63077 status: open, not merged, bot-review only, created 2026-08-22
- [x] Verify licensing: `gpui` + platform subcrates are Apache-2.0; Zed repo carries dual LICENSE-APACHE/LICENSE-GPL
- [x] User decision Q1: process architecture → **C: out-of-process helper** (ADR 002, 2026-08-24)
- [x] User decision Q2: repo license → **Apache-2.0** (ADR 003, 2026-08-24)
- [x] User decision Q3: repo name → **solid-gpui** (local dir `gpuis` still to be renamed by user; renaming under a live session breaks cwd)
- [x] Freeze Phase 1 spec + slices in PLAN.md after Q1–Q3 (spec frozen 2026-08-24)
- [ ] Community probe (r/solidjs, Solid Discord) — user action, parallel to Phase 1

### 2026-08-24 - Slice 1: mutation protocol (TS + Rust) with shared fixture
status: active

Seam under test: `encodeBatch`/`decodeBatch` (TS, `@solid-gpui/protocol`) and
`from_json`/`to_json` + `MutationHandler` (Rust, `solid-gpui-protocol`), plus one shared
JSON fixture consumed by both languages (cross-language wire contract).

- [x] Scaffold: workspace roots, LICENSE (Apache-2.0), packages/protocol, crates/protocol
- [x] RED: TS tests (bun test) fail on stubbed encode/decode — 0 pass / 13 fail, stub throw observed
- [x] GREEN: TS decode/encode with typed ProtocolError (Result, no throw for recoverable) — 13/13 pass
- [x] RED: Rust tests (cargo test) fail on stubbed from_json — 0 pass / 8 fail, stub Err observed
- [x] GREEN: Rust serde types + pre-checks (unknownOp, version, eventType, id>=1) — 8/8 pass
- [ ] VERIFY: bun test + cargo test + tsc noEmit + cargo clippy clean; independent reviewer verdict; commit

Run report (2026-08-24): RED observed both languages on stubs; GREEN: bun 13/13,
cargo 8/8, tsc noEmit OK (after keyof-index-signature fix), clippy clean (after
let-chains collapse). Reviewer mt6udsof-f64a running; commit deferred until verdict.
